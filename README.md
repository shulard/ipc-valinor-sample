# The Missing Validation Middleware

This tiny repository is an example of how to use the cuyz/valinor PHP library.

It's goal is not to show all the possibilities but to show the code behavior. It's
a companion repository for my talk: [The Missing Validator Middleware](https://public.chstudio.fr/talks/the-missing-validation-middleware/en.html).

## Test and use it !

This repository uses PHP8, so you must have it installed locally to try the code.
You must also have composer available locally.

```bash
git clone â€¦

# Move in the cloned folder

composer install
php index.php
```
